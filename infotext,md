## Infotext for the plugin frontend

The percentage changes of landcover are calculated by comparing the layout, size and underlying Corine Landcover (CLC) types with those of 1900 wind farms analysed throughout Europe by comparing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from before and after the development of wind turbines. This includes not only the area changed for the basement of a turbine itself, but also layoff areas and newly constructed roads. The numbers presented are calculated within the concave hull bounds around the turbines on the map.
